# Requirements

To use `mcpd`, ensure the following tools are installed:

- [`uv` / `uvx`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) — for running `uvx` Python packages
- [`npx` / `npm` / `NodeJS`](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) — for running JavaScript/TypeScript packages
- [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) — only required for building and developing `mcpd`

!!! note "Internet Connectivity"
    `mcpd` requires internet access to contact package registries and to allow MCP servers access to the internet if required when running.
