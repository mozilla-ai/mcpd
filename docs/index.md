# mcpd

> *Run your agents, not your infrastructure.*

---

`mcpd` is a toolchain and runtime developed by [Mozilla AI](https://mozilla.ai) that simplifies the configuration, 
execution and integration of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers with your agentic application.
It is intended to provide the same experience across local development and production environments.

It removes the friction of cross-language server orchestration, secrets management, version pinning, and lifecycle control.

## ✨ Why `mcpd`?

Traditional agent frameworks often embed complex subprocess logic, brittle startup scripts, and ad-hoc 'desktop style' config. 

`mcpd` replaces this with:

🧪 **Zero-Config Tool Setup**  
  No cloning repos or installing language-specific dependencies. `mcpd add` and `mcpd daemon` handle everything.

🌍 **Language-Agnostic Tooling**  
  Use MCP servers written in Python (`uvx`), JavaScript/TypeScript (`npx`) in your code via a HTTP REST API that supports routing to MCP Servers.

🧭 **Declarative Tool Management**  
  Define version-pinned MCP servers and tools in `.mcpd.toml`. Reproducible, consistent, and CI-friendly.

🔐 **Project config separated from runtime variables**  
  Args and environment variables per server e.g. `~/.config/mcpd/secrets.dev.toml`. Never commit dev specific vars to Git again.

🛠️ **Unified Dev Experience**  
  One command: `mcpd daemon`. Starts and manages all servers behind the scenes.

🧰 **Intuitive SDK Integration**  
  The Python `mcpd_sdk` makes calling tools feel like native function calls; no HTTP, STDIO, or SSE boilerplate.
  Even easier for users of [any-agent](https://github.com/mozilla-ai/any-agent) via `.agent_tools()`.

🚀 **Seamless Local-to-Prod Transition**  
  The same `.mcpd.toml` and agent code work in dev, CI, and cloud environments without modification.
