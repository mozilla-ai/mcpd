`mcpd` is a toolchain and runtime developed by [Mozilla AI](https://mozilla.ai) that simplifies the configuration, 
execution and integration of [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/overview) (MCP) servers with your agentic application.
It is intended to provide the same experience across local, development and production environments.

It removes the friction of cross-language server orchestration, secrets management, version pinning, and lifecycle control.

## Why `mcpd`?

Traditional agent frameworks often embed complex subprocess logic, brittle startup scripts, and ad-hoc 'desktop style' config. 

`mcpd` replaces this with:

**Zero-Config Tool Setup**  
  No cloning repos or installing language-specific dependencies. `mcpd add` and `mcpd daemon` handle everything.

**Language-Agnostic Tooling**  
  Use MCP servers written in Python (`uvx`), JavaScript/TypeScript (`npx`) in your code via a HTTP REST API that supports routing to MCP Servers.

**Declarative Tool Management**  
  Define version-pinned MCP servers and tools in `.mcpd.toml`. Reproducible, consistent, and CI-friendly.

**Project config separated from runtime variables**  
  Exportable args and environment variables per server e.g. `~/.config/mcpd/secrets.dev.toml`. 
Never commit dev specific vars to Git again.

**Unified Dev Experience**  
  One command: `mcpd daemon`. Starts and manages all servers behind the scenes.

**Intuitive SDK Integration**  
  The Python `mcpd_sdk` makes calling tools feel like native function calls; no HTTP, STDIO, or SSE boilerplate.
  Even easier for users of [any-agent](https://github.com/mozilla-ai/any-agent) via `.agent_tools()`.

**Seamless Local-to-Prod Transition**  
  The same `.mcpd.toml` and agent code work in dev, CI, and cloud environments without modification.

## Deploy Anywhere

`mcpd` is runtime-flexible and infrastructure-agnostic:

- ‚öôÔ∏è Works in any container or host with `uv` and `npx`
- ‚òÅÔ∏è Multi-cloud ready (AWS, GCP, Azure, on-prem)
- ‚ôªÔ∏è Low resource overhead via in-process server management

---

## üì¶ Install

### Homebrew

Add the [Mozilla.ai tap](https://github.com/mozilla-ai/homebrew-tap):

```bash
brew tap mozilla-ai/tap
```

Then install `mcpd`:

```bash
brew install mcpd
```

Or install directly from the cask in a single command:

```bash
brew install --cask mozilla-ai/tap/mcpd
```
