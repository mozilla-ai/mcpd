# Makefile Usage

The `mcpd` project includes a `Makefile` to streamline common developer tasks. 

!!! warning "Running make"
    All commands should be run from the **root of the repository**.

## Commands

!!! note "Environment"
    Most commands assume you have Go installed and available in your `PATH`.

### üß± Build Commands

- **Build the binary**
    ```bash
    make build
    ```

- **Remove the compiled binary from the working directory**
    ```bash
    make clean
    ```

- **Install the binary to your system (typically `/usr/local/bin`)**
    ```bash
    sudo make install
    ```

- **Uninstall the binary**
    ```bash
    sudo make uninstall
    ```

---

### üß™ Test Commands

- **Run all Go tests**
    ```bash
    make test
    ```

---

## üìù Documentation Commands

These commands manage the [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) developer documentation site for `mcpd`.

- **Generate CLI reference docs from the Cobra commands**
    ```bash
    make docs-cli
    ```

- **Update `mkdocs.yaml` navigation for the CLI commands**
    ```bash
    make docs-nav
    ```

- **Serve the docs locally using MkDocs + uv**
    ```bash
    make docs-local
    ```

- **Full pipeline: generate CLI docs, update nav, serve locally**
    ```bash
    make docs
    ```

!!! tip "First time?"
    The `docs-local` command will create a virtual environment using `uv`, install MkDocs + Material theme, and start the local server at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
